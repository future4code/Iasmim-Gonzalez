        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <img src="../images/perfil.jpg" alt="Iasmim Gonzalez">
        <p>
            I’m 23 years old, I live in Curitiba-PR, 
            Brasil, and my history with programing 
            started not long ago. After almost 3 years 
            working for a company in a completely
            diferent field, I realized that I wasn’t 
            happy at all and I needed to change 
            things. I wanted desperately to change
            where I was going and how my future was
            going to be.
            Then I decided that I wanted to code.
            Not just because I really enjoy it, but also 
            because code would give the oportunity 
            to change things. To change my life
            and others peolple’s life. That’s what I’ve been
            puting all of my effort to.
